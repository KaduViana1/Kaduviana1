Hi, my name is Carlos Eduardo, but you can call me Kadu!

I've always been fascinated by technology, so I decided to start a career as a Developer.

Currently I'm focused to become as best as I can get with Full-Stack Web Development.

I'm especially used to work with javascript, React.js and Node.js, but willingly and longing to learn any new technologies to build better and better projects.
